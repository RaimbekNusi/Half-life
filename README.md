# Half Life
## Description

Radioactive materials decay over time and turn into other substances. For example, Carbon-14 decays into Nitrogen-14 through beta decay. 

The rate of radioactive decay of a material is measured in terms of its half-life. The half-life of a material is defined to be the amount of time it takes for half of the material to undergo radioactive decay. Let m be the initial mass in grams of some material and let h be the materialâ€™s half-life in days. Then the remaining mass of the material on day t, denoted m(t), is given by the formula:
